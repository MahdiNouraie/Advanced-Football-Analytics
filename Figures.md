*Figure 1.  The Three Main Steps of the Methodology. 1) The model normalizes both classic and advanced player features as inputs for hierarchical clustering, followed by evaluating cluster robustness. 2) Representative features are identified from each cluster using the Pearson correlation matrix derived from the clustering output.  3) The representative features are then used as predictor variables, with the remaining features serving as response variables in the regression models.*
